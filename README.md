# Business-Case-OLA-Driver-Attrition-Prediction
This project addresses the critical business problem of high driver churn at OLA, a leading ride-sharing platform. Using a comprehensive driver dataset from 2019â€“2020, the goal was to predict whether a driver is likely to leave the company, enabling OLA to proactively implement retention strategies.
